## Why should an organization contribute data to OpenStreetMap?

* Adding data to OSM is quicker and easier than building your own system: you benefit from updates to the software, the ecosystem and collaborative maintenance and improvement of the data
* Allows an organisation to focus on its core data, rather than also maintaining geospatial data
* OSM is a shared platform to contribute and collaborate with others
* Broader social good of contributing to a global map

Here are some [general guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/How_We_Map) for contributing. If you are thinking about importing an existing data set, [read our import guidelines closely](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines) and particularly note [license compatibility](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines#Step_3_-_License_approval).

## What other ways can we contribute?

* Becoming a [member or supporter](about-osm-community/donate-to-osm/) helps contribute to the sustainability of the project. A [number of companies](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Corporate_Members), for example, are supporters.
* Contributing imagery or other data such as GPS traces or your GIS data can help improve the map for all and provide a means for the community to use that information to collect new data. It is important to release that data under an open license as well
* There’s also a range of supporting open source infrastructure which would benefit from contribution and support from wider community
* There is also a need for advocacy about OpenStreetMap, training, community engagement and more. You can contribute to OpenStreetMap without actually editing the map.
* Participate in the governance and work of OpenStreetMap Foundation through [working groups](about-osm-community/working-groups/)

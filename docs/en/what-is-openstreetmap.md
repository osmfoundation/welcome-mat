[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org){:target="_blank"} is a free, editable map of the whole world made by people like you. It was started in 2004 in the UK, out of frustration with the lack of availability of good map data that was free to use.

OpenStreetMap includes data about roads, buildings, addresses, shops and businesses, points of interest, railways, trails, transit, land use and natural features, and much more.

The map is created and maintained by nearly 5 million registered users and more than 1 million map contributors in every country in the world, using free tools and software. The data is used by local people, volunteer groups, companies, governments, software developers and more.

The project has a very lean governance structure, run entirely by the volunteers of the
[OpenStreetMap Foundation](/about-osm-community/osm-foundation.md). Financial support comes from the OpenStreetMap Foundation members, including corporate members, as well as
[donations](/about-osm-community/donate-to-osm.md).

As a decentralized project, there are many different ways to get in touch with the OpenStreetMap community, it depends on what you want to ask about.

The [Working Groups](/about-osm-community/working-groups.md) may cover your question if it’s about a specific topic such as licensing or press inquiries.

If you want to talk with the community in a specific country or region, please consult the [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org){:target="_blank"}.

If you need more help with contacting communities, try the [OSM contact channels](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contact_channels){:target="_blank"} page.

Here is [more information](/about-osm-community/donate-to-osm.md) about donating to OSM.

If you are interested in contributing or donating to OpenStreetMap, or for any other questions, please get in touch with the OSM Foundation Board of Directors at [board(at)osmfoundation.org](mailto:board@osmfoundation.org).

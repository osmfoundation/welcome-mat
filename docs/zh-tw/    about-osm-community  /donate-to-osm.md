[開放街圖](https://openstreetmap.org){:target="_blank"}是全球最大的開放地理資料庫，其資料結構支援全球的畫地圖專案。捐款給開街圖基金會能夠支付營運支出，支持整體開放街圖專案發展：硬體支出、法律服務費用、行政助理以及其他與工作小組與管理的支出。

OSM 相當精實，開放街圖基金會依靠個人與企業會員會費，年度 State of the Map 大會的營餘，以及捐款。我們破保多元的收入來源，因為每年都可能有變化，但我們最低的需求維持不變，因此我們需要你的支持。

有許多方式能給予財務支持：

## 企業會員

If you are part of a company or organization, a great way to support OpenStreetMap financially is by becoming a [Corporate Member](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Membership#Corporate_Members){:target="_blank"} of the OpenStreetMap Foundation.

Corporate membership tiers start at €500 for the Supporter level and go up to €20,000 or more annually for the Platinum level. Each tier comes with a number of additional benefits. Corporate members of Silver and higher levels have a seat on the [OSMF Advisory Board](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Advisory_Board){:target="_blank"}, which serves to advise the OSMF Board of Directors.

If you are interested in becoming a Corporate Member or learning more about donating, please get in touch with the OSM Foundation Board of Directors at [board(at)osmfoundation.org](mailto:board@osmfoundation.org).

## 捐款

[Donations](https://donate.openstreetmap.org){:target="_blank"} of any amount are also more than welcome. The OpenStreetMap Foundation is a registered non-profit in the United Kingdom.

## 地方分會

If an OSM Local Chapter exists in your jurisdiction, you may also want to consider donating to them directly. Donations to Local Chapters benefit their work supporting the OpenStreetMap project and community at the local level. Donations to Local Chapters may be tax-exempt, depending on local tax law. For details, inquire with the Local Chapter directly. You can find them at the [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Foundation/Local_Chapters){:target="_blank"}

## 大會

There are a variety of OpenStreetMap conferences, and ticket revenues help sustain the community. The annual international OpenStreetMap conference is called [State of the Map](https://stateofthemap.org){:target="_blank"}. There are also many [regional](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map#Regional.2Flocal_conferences){:target="_blank"} State of the Map conferences.

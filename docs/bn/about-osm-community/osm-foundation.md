OpenStreetMap is not a closely governed or managed project; grassroots activities are the core of the movement, and individuals participating in OpenStreetMap enjoy great freedom. The OpenStreetMap Foundation is the nonprofit organization that supports OpenStreetMap and provides the necessary organizational backbone. It is made up of a number of different members and groups.

* **[OSMF Members](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Membership){:target="_blank"}:** members who have paid dues to join the OpenStreetMap Foundation. They can vote on the OpenStreetMap Foundation Board of Directors and give their opinions on board matters. You can join [here](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Membership){:target="_blank"}.
* **[OSMF Board of Directors](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Officers_%26_Board){:target="_blank"}:** seven members from around the world who serve as the key governance body of the OpenStreetMap Foundation.
* **[Local Chapters](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Local_Chapters){:target="_blank"}:** country-specific organizations that act on behalf of the OpenStreetMap Foundation, organising activities like OpenStreetMap editing projects, events and conferences in their areas. Local Chapters are officially registered nonprofit organizations. Note that many countries do not have an officially chartered Chapter, but still have active editing.
* **[Working Groups](/about-osm-community/working-groups.md):** groups organized by the OpenStreetMap Foundation that handle specific topics like operating the OSM servers, handling data issues, managing legal and licensing issues, running communications about OpenStreetMap, organizing the annual State of the Map conference and much more.
* **[Corporate Members](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Corporate_Members){:target="_blank"}:** corporate supporters of OpenStreetMap who donate different amounts of money to the OpenStreetMap Foundation. Here is more information about [becoming a corporate member](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Join_as_a_corporate_member){:target="_blank"}.
* **[Advisory Board](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Advisory_Board){:target="_blank"}:** a group that serves to advise the OSM Foundation Board of Directors, made up of official Local Chapters and Gold & Platinum Corporate Members
